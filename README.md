# gamesInC
Trying to create simple game in plain C, just for fun.

This is simple project, where I am trying to code simple snake game in linux terminal using plain C.

The snake's name is Jeffrey, please be kind to him, even tho he is incomplete.

For executing the program run following commands in root directory:

```
meson setup builddir && cd builddir
ninja
./game
```
